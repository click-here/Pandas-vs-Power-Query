# Pandas-vs-Power-Query

It has been my experience that people often work with data inefficiently in Excel. The purpose of this repo is to introduce users to some of the basic tools at their disposal using the Excel Add-in [PowerQuery](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379) as well as to introduce them to similar methods with the Python data science library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). 

If you are new to Power Query I strongly recommend viewing Part 1 as subsequent Parts will assume basic knowledge explained in Part 1.

## Part 1 - Reading and Grouping
Read multiple csv files and an Excel file. Group, filter, and aggregate data. Perform column level math and basic grouping/aggregation math.
